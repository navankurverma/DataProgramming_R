# Europe Crime Analysis in R

direct [link](https://navankurverma.github.io/Euro_Crime_Analysis_R/Euro_Crime_Analysis.html)

I used data from Eurostat and CSO Ireland website (links to datasets are present in above link), to find out key points in data and visualize data such that in single graphics most of the data could be represented.

I have used below packages in this reop:
1. rio - for importing the datasets
2. tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, tibble) - for manipulation and visualisation of data
3. gganimate - for animating the visual output
4. gifski, png - dependencies of gganimate
